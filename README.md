todo:
change name in all writings

willowolf vs wolf of the way

desert.willowolf vs fg.willowolf
  - desert creates a distinct type and image of a willowolf, whereas fg directly tells what the project is about
  - * i really don't like that OSs use this kind of naming convention. Mac OS's snow leapord or Ubuntu's gazelle has nothing to do with the product, except associate an image. Does desert willowolf do more? Or is it just a lame mascot?
  - fg.willowolf, the willowolf of fighting games, makes sense, similar to fighting games way of the wolf (fg.wayofthewolf). thus, desert willowolf does indeed feel like an extraneous mascot
  - can use domain redirects (or even aliases! ...but shouldn't)

fg.willowolf.com, redirects: desert, fight, fighting, fightinggames  
eg.willowolf.com, redirects: forest, experiment, experimental, experimentalgames  
ng.willowolf.com, redirects: mountain, nature, natural, naturesguardians, dao
