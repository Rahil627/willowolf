#### notes
can keep notes that affect all of the sub-domain sites here

this part of the readme serves as a simple version of GitHub's projects 'n issues. Start with those features off (in the repo's settings), then add features as needed... but i'd prefer a simple single text file for everything.

for sites should be controlled by me (like this one), remember to keep the wiki access restricted! For sites with a public wiki, make it un-restricted. `Settings, under the Features section, un-check 'Restrict editing to collaborators only'`

in the future, when GitHub Pages isn't enough, change the DNS of the domains form using BasicDNS to my web server's DNS (Namecheap) which can be altered through cPanel. Change the `A records` back to my web host's servers, 'n build 'n deploy from my local computer (or set-up some similar way to auto-build upon git changes from my web server?).

todo:
change name in all writings  
the current image for this repo is kinda creepy...

#### discord notes
when getting the link ("invite"), you have to click on settings / edit so that you can set it to permanent. Otherwise, you'll end up linking temporary links! :/ It seems like permanent links are a character longer than temporary ones...
