The Way of Nature's Guardians provides a digital common space for people that either live in nature, are striving to go back to nature, strive to protect those people, make tools to aid these people... // Wherever you were born, whatever your culture, whatever your history, you know the right way to live: with nature. It's for people that live a slow life, living and learning at the pace of plants, growing with them, dying with them, only to be reborn again and again, changing one's self entirely several times, as we get closer to nature.

...At the moment, this site there's nothing else on this site. Soon it will become a knowledge-base. And hopefully after that, I'll add some tools for the people to use!
