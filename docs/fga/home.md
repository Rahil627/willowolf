### rathewolf's fighting game anarchy / aka the way of fighting games
is a digital anarchist diy community interested in the research and development of fighting games

come 'n hang out at [the discord!](https://discord.gg/FtAQws9)

if that's empty, you can read 'n contribute to [the wiki](https://github.com/Rahil627/fighting-game-anarchy/wiki)

if that's not enough, you can halp me make [this site](https://rahil627.github.io/fighting-game-anarchy/)(!!), to which the wiki may be ported to soon. The site's source is in the docs folder; it's hosted and automatically built by GitHub Pages, and generated using Jekyll. Just ask for permission (git access permissions). Sooo much to do!! :) :) Halp find or make an awesome theme. Halp transform those lists into readable tables (csv vs flat-file database). Add your own cool art 'n animation! Do what you want.

### notes
todo:\
...how long does it take for GitHub to update the site? (to auto build the site and publish it)  
answer: as long as it took me to write that question.


welp, the site works, but the theme doesn't...  
fixed: changed layout-value to `default`... a little strange though, what about `page` and `post` values?
