# welcome to willowolf (will-o'-wolf)

this site is a digital space for my [(rathewolf)](https://rathewolf.com) altruistic desires: my wills, manifested digitally. It’s also a spirit animal representing a will. :)

it's holds the web-sites of digital organizations 'n tools 'n other digital stuff i've organized/made for *the people*.

#### digital organizations
these are sites for various digital organizations i've began, each one with a specific shared interest / direction.

all should share good values: informal, *street*, *community-oriented*, *diy*, punk, *anarchist*, feminist theory, etc. ...we’ll see what happens.
..

each organization derives from a will i have/had for a long period of time
- [an anarchy focused on true life](https://willowolf.com/nga), the will to research 'n develop ways to make a better world :) :)
- [an anarchy focused on experimental games](https://willowolf.com/ega), the will to research, develop, 'n love experimental games
- [an anarchy focused on fighting games](https://willowolf.com/fga), the will to research, develop, 'n love fighting games
